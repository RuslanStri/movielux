# My first react project. 

## Info

A project for searching movies and TV series to watch, and adding them to the “watch later” list.

Data is taken from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.

This project does not implement creating accounts, so movie IDs will be stored in local storage.

React Router and React Axios are also used.

The development of the project occurs only in my free time.

## Start

To start the project, clone the repository and run the "npm start" command in the terminal.

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.
